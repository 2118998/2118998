Message: AADSTS90072: User account 'mf6092959@gmail.com' from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant 'Transocean' and cannot access the application 'https://advocate.socialchorus.com/transocean/transocean/saml/metadata'(Transocean Current) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account
